# decoder-ring

This application allows the user to encode and decode messages using the polybius square, caesar shift, and substitution cipher as different methods of encoding and decoding those messages. The caesar shift shifts all characters a specified number of characters to the right to encode. The polybius square translates characters to numbers. Lastly, the substitution cipher uses a mixed alphabet to encode messages.
